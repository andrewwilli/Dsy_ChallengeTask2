# Challenge Task FS 2023

This semester's challenge task (CT) is the design and implementation of a simple distributed system (of your choice), with at least one service with a websocket, and where a service instance can fail. The system needs to have the following components:

1. Simple Frontend (e.g., HTML, Vue, React, Svelte)
2. Loadbalancer(e.g., traefik, nginx, HAproxy, Caddy)
3. Two instances of a service (your choice), and during the challenge task presentation, one instance will be shut off.
4. One storage backend

## Requirements

All requirements below must be met in order to pass this lecture.
1. Load balancing with scalable service
2. Failover of a service instance
3. Dockerized and Frontend connects via HTTP/3
4. Persistant storage (storage does not need to be scalable, but you can build it scalable if you want)
5. Use latest stable releases of chosen libraries and frameworks


## Deliverables

Hand-in 1: 17.04.2023, 23:59 (CET)  - initial version of your project.

Final hand-in: 22.05.2023, 23:59 (CET) (CET) - well documented infrastructure, presentation (slides) of the application, also showing the architecture and design decisions via email to thomas.ost-at-bocek.ch or via a repository invite. The code and configuration should be easy to read and/or well documented, the presentation (slides or text) should show the architecture, components, and design decisions. During the weeks 23.05./30.05., you will present and demo your solutions onsite.
